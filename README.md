Adebug 2.13 - 68060 patched
===========================

This package provides the current Adebug Reloaded 2.13 release, patched to
work with the 68060. The patch works on a CT60, but only under plain TOS. The
debugger doesn't quit correctly under MagiC! 6.20 and was not tested with
FreeMiNT.

The patch is ugly and is not meant for final distribution. It's dated from
2008, but development didn't go further as my CT60 burnt. I hope to get it
repaired soon and get back to this and clean things up.
