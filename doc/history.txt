Adebug Reloaded history
-----------------------

2007-01-18
	+ Release of Adebug Reloaded v2.13 under the terms of the GPL 
	  licence.
	+ The video switching problem (on Falcon with extended video 
	  modes) is solved. Is was due to a wrong wait_vbl routine.
	+ After a deep study of IPL7 capable wait_vbl routines, a 
	  stronger wait_full_vbl routine has been added, and the 
	  weakness of the first one has been documented.
2006-07-11
	+ First patch for the video switching issue, but the added 
	  wait_vbl2 routine was wrong. Only luck made it work. Anyway, 
	  thanks a lot Thomas for the video management sources of 
	  Sector One. These helped a lot!
2006-01-19
	+ The adebug.brainstorm.fr CVS repository is set up. It 
	  requires SSH access, so for now, only Benjamin has one. The 
	  sent sources have been approved by Brainstorm that have 
	  commited them in the reporitory.
2005-06-08 to 2006-06-01
	+ The C_EVAL fork (of Sept 1994) version of Adebug has been 
	  privately released to some very few people that had asked to 
	  Benjamin by e-mail (Seb B., Florent L., Thomas R., Fred B., 
	  and Michael H.).
2005-05-24
	+ A packaging has been sent to Brainstorm for validation. 
	  Sadly, the mistake is that these are the sources of the 
	  C_EVAL fork (of Sept 1994) and not the mainstream version.
2005-05-07
	+ Adebug sources transmitted to Benjamin (the C_EVAL fork of 
	  Sept 1994, the Adebug mainstream of mid Dec 1994, and the 
	  C_EVAL final merge of end Dec 1994).
2003-10-08
	+ Adebug project opened on SourceForge.net. Decision is taken 
	  to release it under the terms of the GPL licence.
1994-12-14
	+ Latest known binary release of Adebug v2.12 on BBS Brazil.

Former history of Adebug v2.12 (the never increased version number, 
see README.TXT for more details) is in the Frenche HISTOIRE.TXT file 
(sorry for English speakers).
