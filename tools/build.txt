How to build Adebug Reloaded with the BUILDER tool
--------------------------------------------------

Absolute prerequisite, you need Assemble (especially ASM.TTP).

If you intend to use this BUILDER tool I wrote, you won't need 
anything else:

1/ Edit BUILDER.CNF and adapt the path of ASM.TTP to your 
   configuration. The BUILDER.TTP tool uses <c:\asm\asm.ttp> as fall 
   back when no <builder.cnf> config file is found.
2/ Get sure that BUILDER.TTP can access your sources in the <..\src\> 
   directory.
3/ Run BUILDER.TTP with no argument in order to know the command line 
   argument syntax. ;-)
4/ Run BUILDER.TTP passing the disired target number as first and only 
   argument.
5/ After BUILDER.TTP completes, the built binary target is in your 
   source folder. If you want it in another folder, you'll have to do 
   it by hand, or send me a patch for the builder. ;-)


This BUILDER tool is released under the term of the GPL licence. See 
COPYING.TXT for more details.

Have a nice time with Adebug Reloaded!
